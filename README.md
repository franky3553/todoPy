### üßêAbout

pyTvocabulary has been created with the purpose of free up mental space that produces thinking about all the tasks to be done

There are other options on the market, but the main task of pyTODOlist is to keep you completely focused on your work, keeping your todolist in a separate window, always accessible, and deleting it all when your work is done.

Don't take the burden with you!
